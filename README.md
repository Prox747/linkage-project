# linkage-project



## ⬇️ Setup
To execute the project you need the necessary libraries, in the following step we install the libraries using virtualenv but you can use a different environment.

If you don't have the virtualenv installed:
```
pip install virtualenv
```
Create the virtual environment with:
```
virtualenv .venv
```
Then activate the virtual environment, execute:
```
. .venv/bin/activate
```
Or (on windows):
```
.venv/Scripts/activate.bat
```
Finally get the libraries with:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt (remove comments in the file requirements.txt if you have a Windows machine)
```
